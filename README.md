# MY-ASTEROID
My-asteroid is a clone of the iconic arcade game Asteroids by Atari in 1979. It's a single player-game arcade game where you need to destroy astros and save yourself  of collisions while you make points.

## How to play

- **[Up_arrow]:** you boost yourself as you press it.
- **[left_right_arrow]:** you turn yourself  in that direction as you press it.
- The game is over when you are hitting by a astro.
- Each shot splits the stars into two pieces, until they are so small that you can destroy them and score 10 points.
